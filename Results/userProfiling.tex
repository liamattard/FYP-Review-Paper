\subsection{Automatic User Profiling}

We trained the Keras Sequential model using the NVIDIA
Tesla K80 GPU provided by Google Colab. At 16 epochs,
the model starts to overfit as the validation loss
starts to increase. The testing dataset consists of
500 images manually gathered using the Unsplash API. 


When comparing the Resnet 50, Resnet 18 and Keras
Sequential model,the Reset 50 achieved the best
average accuracy, precision and recall. The resnet 50 achieved the highest F1 score the
on testing dataset with an average F1 score of 76.29. So
we decided to use it as our baseline for the tourist
itinerary generation application.
