\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have introduced an automatic preference gathering technique to a TTDP
solution that produces an activity plan through the user's social media photos
and pages they follow. As a result, the system can produce personalised results
within a few seconds. An additional approach targets individuals who do not
feel their online presence represents their travel preferences, such as
gathering using Natural Language techniques to scan the user's text posts.
Although there is always room for further development, we form the basis to
show how an automatic preference gathering system can further assist a
travel application to achieve satisfactory results.
