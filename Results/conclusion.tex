\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have introduced an automatic preference gathering technique that scans a
user's social media profile and analyses the user's photos and liked pages. As
a result, we have built an application to optimise TTDP solutions in a
personalised manner. More diverse approaches through social media could target
people who do not feel their online presence represents their travel preferences,
such as gathering using Natural Language techniques to scan the user's
text posts. Although there is always room for further development, we form
the basis to show how a automatic preference gathering system can further
assist a travel-related application to achieve more satisfactory results.
