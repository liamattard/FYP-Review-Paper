\subsection{Conclusion}
We have concluded that it is possible to gather characteristics from social media throughout this
research. Therefore, we will introduce this technology to generate user
profiles as part of a constraint with the objective function of the
optimisation algorithm.

Since the evolutionary algorithms, PSO and GA, resulted in competing solutions
on the Tsilgidres Dataset and are used in novel solutions~\cite{Yu2019,
Wisittipanich2020}, we will compare both algorithms to see which one to use as
the baseline for our TDOPTW application.
