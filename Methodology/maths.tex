The objective function of our itinerary planner is:

\[ \text{MAX}  \sum_{m=0}^{M} ( S_{{D_m}} + S_{{E_m}}) \]
where:
\\
\begin{tabular}{l l}
% \textit{i,j}:  &  POI (\textit{i,j} = 2,3,...,\textit{N}) \\
\textit{m} & Travelling day (\textit{m}=1,2,\ldots, \textit{M}) \\ 
\textit{$D_m$} & Morning section of day number m \\  
\textit{$E_m$} & Evening section of day number m \\  
\textit{$S_{D_m}$} & Score of the morning section $D_m$ \\  
\textit{$S_{E_m}$} & Score of the evening section $E_m$ \\  
\end{tabular}
\\
\\

A day is made up of the morning ${D_m}$ section and
the evening ${E_m}$ section. The timetable suggests a
POI in the morning, then somewhere to eat, and the
rest is dependant on the activity pace C. That is why
the morning section is made up of $C + 2$ tourist
attractions. The evening section suggests a place to
eat and a POI; therefore, the evening section is just
made up of $2$. 

\begin{center}
$D_m = Y_i + Y_f + C ( Y_i)$ and $E_m = Y_f + Y_j $

\end{center}



\begin{tabular}{l l}

\textit{i} & Morning attraction (i = 1,…, $n_1$)\\
\textit{j} & Evening attraction (j = 1,…, $n_2$)\\
\textit{f} & Food Place (f = 1,…, $n_3$)\\
\textit{$Y_{i|f|j}$}: & Number of times POI is visited. \\
\end{tabular}
\\ 
\\
\begin{tabular}{l l}
\textbf{Constraints} & \\
\textit{$ \sum_{m=0}^{M}\sum_{i=0}^{n_1}{Y_i} \leq 1$} & Ensures morning POIs\\ & not visited more than once. \\

\textit{$ \sum_{m=0}^{M}\sum_{j=0}^{n_1}{Y_j} \leq 1$} & Ensures evening POIs\\ & not visited more than once.\\


\end{tabular}

The score $S_{D_m}$ or $S_{E_m}$ is calculated using

\[ S_{D_m | E_m} = \frac{1}{T} + R + V\]

where:
\\
\begin{tabular}{l l}
% \textit{i,j}:  &  POI (\textit{i,j} = 2,3,...,\textit{N}) \\
\textit{T} & Distance between POIs of day m\\ 
\textit{R} & Average rating of POIs of day m\\  
\textit{V} & How much POIs match with the \\ &  user's travel interest vector. \\  

\end{tabular}
