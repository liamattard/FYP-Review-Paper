\textit{M}:  &  The number of travelling days \\

The objective function of our itinerary planner is:

\[ \text{MAX}  \sum_{m=0}^{M} ( S_{{D_m}} + S_{{E_m}}) \]
where:
\\
\begin{tabular}{l l}
% \textit{i,j}:  &  POI (\textit{i,j} = 2,3,...,\textit{N}) \\
\textit{m} & Travelling day (\textit{m}=1,2,\ldots, textit{M}) \\ 
\textit{$D_m$} & Morning section of day number m \\  
\textit{$E_m$} & Evening section of day number m \\  
\textit{$S_{D_m}$} & Score of the morning section $D_m$ \\  
\textit{$S_{E_m}$} & Score of the evening section $E_m$ \\  
\end{tabular}

A day is made up of the morning ${D_m}$ section and
the evening ${E_m}$ section. The timetable suggests a
POI in the morning, then somewhere to eat, and the
rest is dependant on the activity pace C. That is why
the morning section is made up of $C + 2$ tourist
attractions. The evening section suggests a place to
eat and a POI; therefore, the evening section is just
made up of $2$. 


\[D_m = Y_i + Y_f + C ( Y_i) \]
\[E_m = Y_f + Y_j \]

\begin{tabular}{l l}

\textit{i} & Morning Tourist attraction (i = 1, 2, 3,…, $n_1$)\\
\textit{j} & Evening Tourist attraction (j = 1,2, 3,…, $n_2$)\\
\textit{f} & Food Place (f = 1,2, 3,…, $n_3$)\\
\textit{$Y_{i|f|j}$}: & 1 if a tourist visit attraction i, j or f and  0 if otherwise\\
\end{tabular}
\\ 
\\
\begin{tabular}{l l}
\textbf{Constraints} & \\
\textit{$ \sum_{m=0}^{M}\sum_{i=0}^{n_1}{Y_i} \leq 1$} & Ensures that all morning tourist attractions are \\ & not visited more than once throughout the whole \\ & itinerary\\

\textit{$ \sum_{m=0}^{M}\sum_{j=0}^{n_1}{Y_j} \leq 1$} & Ensures that all evening tourist attractions are \\ & not visited only once throughout the whole \\ & itinerary\\


\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Calculation of Score}

The score $S_{D_m}$ or $S_{E_m}$ is calculated using

\[ S_{D_m | E_m} = \frac{1}{T} + R + V\]

where:
\\
\begin{tabular}{l l}
% \textit{i,j}:  &  POI (\textit{i,j} = 2,3,...,\textit{N}) \\
\textit{T} & Total distance between each tourist attractions in the \\ & morning/evening of day m\\ 
\textit{R} & Average rating of the tourist attractions in the \\ & morning/evening of day m \\  
\textit{V} & how much the tourist attractions of the \\ & morning/evening of day m match with the user's \\ & travel interest vector \\  

\end{tabular}
