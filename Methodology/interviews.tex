\subsubsection{In-Depth Semi-Structured Interviews}
Twenty participants used our application and asked them several questions. The
target audience of our interviews were a balance between people who feel social
media profile does or does not reflect their itinerary preferences.  The
interview starts by generating two itineraries; a  personalised itinerary
and an itinerary where the travel interest vector is ignored.  However, the
participants were not told which one was which. The order of timetables was
mixed to avoid anchor bias. First, we discussed what the interviewee looks for in a
holiday to check whether this matches their travel interest vector.  We asked
them to review both timetables and which one they think was more personalised.
The interviewees were then shown their automatically generated characteristics
and asked to review.  Finally, we discussed some considerations and future
improvements regarding automatic preference gathering from social media.
