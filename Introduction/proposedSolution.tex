To address this problem, we present an application
that helps tourists travel by providing them with a
complete itinerary for their upcoming holiday using
several optimisation algorithms, namely, Genetic
Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO).
With the prevalence of social media and data-driven
approaches, we also automate gathering users' POI
desires by scanning their social media profile using
machine learning classification approaches through
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
