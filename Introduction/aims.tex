\subsection{Aims and Objectives}

We aim to build an application that
generates a personalised holiday plan according to the
user's travel dates and constraints. The following are the objectives:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objective 1 (O1)}: Investigate techniques to build travel interest
    profiles automatically from social media interactions.  
    \item \textbf{Objective 2 (O2)}: Explore different optimisation algorithms for
    building personalised travel itineraries using the
    generated travel interest profiles. 
    \item \textbf{Objective 3 (O3)}: Evaluate the
    performance of the personalised travel itinerary
    generator with real users through in-depth
    semi-structured interviews. 

\end{itemize}

%We will conduct the interviews by generating a
%personalised and non-personalised timetable for a
%holiday in Malta to have prior knowledge of the POIs
%and compare the effects of both itineraries.
