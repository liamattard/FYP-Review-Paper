We present a tourist itinerary recommendation
algorithm that assists upcoming tourists by
autonomously generating a personalised holiday plan
according to their constraints. The system
automatically builds a travel interest profile from
the user's social media presence and recommends places
tailored to the user's interests.  Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) classify the user's social media
pictures into their respective travel category; Beach,
Clubbing, Nature, Museums, Bars and Shopping. These
determine their predominant travel interest topics.
Then, two meta-heuristics, Particle Swarm
Optimisation (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) use this
computed travel profile to optimise a personalised
plan. We evaluate the performance based on their plan
quality and performance.The system was packaged into an application that
allows users to connect with their social media
accounts and generate a plan for a holiday in Malta.
We assessed the effectiveness of implementing
automatic personalisation in a holiday planning
application through in-depth semi-structured
interviews by comparing a personalised and a more
generic itinerary.
